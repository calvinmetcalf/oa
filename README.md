some stuff related to Massachusetts outdoor advertising

the base map has nhs controlled access routes and scenic byways

[take a look](http://calvinmetcalf.github.com/oa/index.html#lat=42.04113400940814&lng=-71.795654296875&zoom=8)

that is over in the gh-pages branch, the main branch also includes the location of all of the outdoor advertising in ma and abilities to search and query.  That one does not involve the same url based query methods as I don't really want to deal with the security aspects.

please use your own api key
